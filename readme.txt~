starting to learn git
git is a distributed version control system
git is free software distributed under the GPL
git has a mutable index called stage

note:
1.mkdir a folder or choose anyone and cd into it
2.use "git init" to make this folder a git repository
3.change something in the folder
4.use "git add <filename>" and git commit -m "some descriptions"
   < PS:same time,we can use "git status" to check out the current    	 
   <	status of this folder/repository ,
   <	"git diff" to see what has been changed,
   <	"git log [--pretty=oneline]" to know the three lastest changes. 
5.use "git reset --hard HEAD^" to back to the last distribution
	(the number of ^s represents the nth from the bottom)
6.HEAD point to current distribution
7.if not add,then won't commit
